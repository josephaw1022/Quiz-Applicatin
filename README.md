## Quiz Applicaiton - Joseph Whiteaker 

This application is a 5 question quiz of some fairly easy questions. 

This application was made in Vite, simply due to tailwind configuration not being obvious and a bit tedious for a vue cli application. There probably is an easy solution out there, but vite does the same thing and the dx is much faster than the cli version of vue so it wasn't worth going down a rabbit hole for a small thing. The application does utilize a bit of typescript to make the structure of the data much easier to understand and to prevent any silly type errors.
